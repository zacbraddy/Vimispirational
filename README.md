## Steps to setup on Windows
1. Got to [vim.org](http://vim.org/) and get the self-installing executable for vim. Install this whereever you wish but remember the path.
1. Install ConEmu, my favourite flavour is [cmder](http://cmder.net/)
1. Pull down my ConEmu settings to give you a basic setup. You need to pull down [this xml file](https://github.com/zacbraddy/Vimispirational/blob/master/con_emu_settings.xml) and then import it into ConEmu through the import functionality available from the settings menu which you can pull up in ConEmu using the shortcut `Win+Alt+P`
1. There are some setting in the ConEMU settings which point to paths on my local machine. Most notably the background image and the path to the vim exectuable for the VIM startup task you'll need to go change them for those to work.
1. Install clink into ConEmu. Download the zip file from [here](https://mridgers.github.io/clink/) then unzip the files directly into `%cmderinstallfolder%\cmder\vendor\conemu-maximus5\ConEmu\clink`. Clink is used to give you advanced autocomplete within the command line. Nothing really to do with vim it just makes ConEmu more powerful.
1. Install [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), just follow the instructions on the README. I used the "brandnew to vim rc file the readme suggests and I also installed [sensible.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) as my first plugin.
1. Install Nerdtree using pathogen by git cloning the nerdtree solution into the bundle folder created during the install of pathogen. This is as per the NERDTree [github repo](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree). When setting the help tags as per the installation instructions on the nerd tree github us `$VIM\bundle\nerdtree\doc\` in place of `~/.vim/bundle/nerdtree/doc/`. This makes the nerd tree reference files work correctly.
1. Create a `vimtmp` folder in the vimfiles directory then add a folder called `backup` one called `swap` and another called `undo`. This is where the swap, undo and backup files for vim are going to be stored so that we don't pollute our `pwd` with them when working. If you don't create this directory then you will get all the swap, undo and backup files being created in the `pwd` as normal.
1. Install Fugitive using the install instructions on the [github repo](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).
1. Install unimpaired using the install instruction on the [github repo](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired).
1. Install the font SauceCodePro NF from [this github repo](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/SourceCodePro) I used the regular weight.
1. Install vim-devicon installation instruction [can be found here](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/vim-devicons). Note that because you installed the font in the last step and the third step is to make changes to the vimrc you only really need to clone the plugin to make this work.
1. Install nerdtree-git-plugin using pathogen as per [github repo instructions](https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin).

## Problems I'm sure I can solve but haven't yet
- Get syntax highlighting for JS and possibly JSX.
- Map nerd tree opening to a keypress
- Install a fuzzy finder
- Making it so that the backup, undo and swap directories are created automatically. Some [ideas for this can be found here](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Remove_swap_and_backup_files_from_your_working_directory)
- Get autocompletiong for Javascript and if possible JSX and C#
- Look into vimgutter to see if it's worth it
- Get a nice colour scheme
- Get surround plugin for quoting and parenthising stuff

## Problems I've managed to overcome

#### Saving the swap and backup files in a different directory

[This answer on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1625850) explains how to save the swap and backup files to another directory and the other answers explain what exactly these files do.

#### Make it so that when I press escape the highlighting from a search goes away

[This answer on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1037182) explains how to map the esc key to the command `:noh` which clears the search history
