# Vimispirational
A repo that documents my journey into trying to be a Vim developer as well as a place to keep my current setup.

## Steps
1. Install ConEmu, my favourite flavour is (cmder)[http://cmder.net/]
1. Pull down my ConEmu settings to give you a basic setup. You need to pull down (this xml file)[https://github.com/zacbraddy/Vimispirational/blob/master/con_emu_settings.xml] and then import it into ConEmu through the import functionality available from the settings menu which you can pull up in ConEmu using the shortcut `Win+Alt+P`
